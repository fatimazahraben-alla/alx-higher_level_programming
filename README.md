# AirBnB clone

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

## AirBnB clone -> The console

### Overview

This is the first step towards building full web application **the AirBnB clone**
This first step is very important to manage the objects of our project, so that we can:

	- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	- Update attributes of an object
	- Destroy an object

### Files and Directories

	- 
`models` 
directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
	- `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
	- `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
	- `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
		- attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
		- methods: save() and to_json()
	- `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes.
